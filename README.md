## Overview
### Convex Hull
Implement Convex Hull Graham's Scan and Gift Wrapping Algorithms on 2D Points and Images, 2D Point has only X-Axis, Y-Axis and Theta (Between 2 Points) Values, on Image You Must Implement Convex Hull Algorithms on Segmented Images that are Stored in [Assets Directory](Assets)

You May Need Fast Sort Algorithm for Image Size of 320 x 240, So Test These Sort Methods for Your Convex Hull Implementation :
* Insertion Sort
* Selection Sort
* Bubble Sort
* Merge Sort
* Quick Sort
